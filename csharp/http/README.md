# CSharp HTTP Function

Welcome to your new CSharp Function! The boilerplate function code can be found in
[`Program.cs`](Program.cs). This Function responds to HTTP requests.

[`appsettings.json`](appsettings.json), [`appsettings.Development.json`](`appsettings.Development.json`) and the Properties folder aren't necessary for building the function, but are there for you to test your code locally.

## Development
<!-- 
Develop new features by adding a test to [`handle_test.go`](handle_test.go) for
each feature, and confirm it works with `go test`. -->

Update the running analog of the function using the `func` CLI or client
library, and it can be invoked from your browser or from the command line:

```console
curl http://myfunction.example.com/
```
